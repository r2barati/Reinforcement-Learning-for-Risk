'''
A simplified example of a reinforcement learning model for credit risk assessment. 
In this example, we create a custom Gym environment called CreditRiskAssessmentEnv that represents the credit risk assessment problem. 
The environment consists of a dataset (credit_data.csv), and the agent's actions are to grant or reject credit applications. 
The reward is assigned based on the outcome of the credit assessment (e.g., successful repayment, default, etc.). 
The Q-learning agent (QLearningAgent) interacts with the environment, updating its Q-table based on the observed 
rewards and using an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. 
The train function trains the agent for a specified number of episodes, 
while the test function allows the agent to make a credit risk assessment decision after training. 
Please note that you would need to provide your own credit risk dataset (credit_data.csv) with appropriate features and labels to 
match the environment's observation and reward setup.
